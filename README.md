## 💡 Key Concepts

### The Three Dimensions of Salvation
| Dimension | Theological Term | Meaning |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Past | Justification | Declared righteous |
| Present | Sanctification | Being made holy |
| Future | Glorification | Complete transformation |

### "In Him" - Ephesians 1:4-5
God chose **the plan** (Christ), not predestined specific individuals for heaven or hell. Those who accept Christ become part of God's chosen people. Anyone who comes to Jesus is chosen "in Him."

### Present Reality, Not Future Hope
We're not waiting for Christ to return to complete our salvation - He is already here, dwelling in His temple (us). Eternal life began the moment we believed. We have already been raised with Christ.

### Grace vs. Works
Good works don't **earn** salvation - they **evidence** it. We're saved by grace alone through faith alone, but genuine faith never remains alone.
